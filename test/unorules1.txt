        UNO IN NUTSHELL :  
        Uno is a very simple yet super-fun card game that anybody can pick up in minutes. It’s all about losing all 
        your cards the quickest. The highlights of the game are the reverse, skip, and draw cards that make it all 
        the more competitive. A favourite during hangouts and sleepovers, students can even sneak in a pack of 
        Uno under their desks and play during boring lectures.
        
        Tip : Don’t forget to say ‘UNO’.
